# SwiftUI Toggle with Dynamic Image Overlay

A lightweight SwiftUI component that extends the standard `Toggle` with a persistent, state-aware image overlay.  
The icon automatically switches sides and symbols based on both toggle state and user interaction, creating instant and intuitive visual feedback.
