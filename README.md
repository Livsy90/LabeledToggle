# SwiftUI Toggle with Dynamic Image Overlay

A lightweight SwiftUI component that extends the standard `Toggle` with a persistent, state-aware image overlay.  
The icon automatically switches sides and symbols based on both toggle state and user interaction, creating instant and intuitive visual feedback.

## Features

- ✅ Persistent icon displayed directly on the toggle  
- 🎯 Real-time response to drag gestures and tap position  
- ⚙️ Adaptive offset calculation based on control width  
- 🌐 Works with both LTR and RTL layout directions  
- 💡 Plug-and-play design — no need to reimplement `ToggleStyle`
